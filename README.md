# CS329masonHARTWEGER
a repo to showcase my CS 329 bots - Mason Hartweger (Northwestern University)

"assignment5" branch: This version includes an "Eight-Legged Spider Climbing Up Stairs" -- The fitness function evaluates the x-coordinate of the spider's torso, and it selects for spiders with the most negative fitness function values (most negative x-coordinates, spider encouraged to move left and up the stairs placed in the world).

To run the repository shown, first download the repository somewhere on your local computer.

Then, install Python 3, install Pyrosim, and install Pybullet according to the instructions at https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/wiki/installation/.

  *NOTE: EARLIER VERSIONS OF PYTHON MAY NOT WORK.
  
Then, change drive (in Terminal) to the correct folder where the downloaded repository files are stored, and execute the command "python3 search.py" to run the simulation.
