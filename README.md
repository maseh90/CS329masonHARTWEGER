# CS329masonHARTWEGER
a repo to showcase my CS 329 bots - Mason Hartweger (Northwestern University)

To run the repository shown, first download the repository somewhere on your local computer.
Then, install Python 3, install Pyrosim, and install Pybullet according to the instructions at https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/wiki/installation/.
  *NOTE: EARLIER VERSIONS OF PYTHON MAY NOT WORK.
Then, change drive (in Terminal) to the correct folder where the downloaded repository files are stored, and execute the command "python3 search.py" to run the simulation.
